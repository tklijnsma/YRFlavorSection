%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Title page %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\cmsNoteHeader{AN-18-999} % This is over-written in the CMS environment: useful as preprint no. for export versions
% >> Title: please make sure that the non-TeX equivalent is in PDFTitle below
\title{Combined measurement and interpretation of differential Higgs boson production cross sections at $\sqrt{s}=13$\,TeV}


% >> Authors
%Author is always "The CMS Collaboration" for PAS and papers, so author, etc, below will be ignored in those cases
%For multiple affiliations, create an address entry for the combination
%To mark authors as primary, use the \author* form
% \address[cern]{CERN}
\address[ethz]{ETH Zurich}
\author[ethz]{M. Donega}
\author[ethz]{T. Klijnsma}
\author[ethz]{P. Musella}


% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.
\date{\today}

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{An abstract}

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
\hypersetup{%
pdfauthor={T. Klijnsma},%
pdftitle={Combination of Higgs boson differential cross sections and limits on Higgs couplings},%
pdfsubject={CMS},%

%% **DO NOT REMOVE THE BIBLIOGRAPHY** which is located before the appendix.
%% You can take the text between here and the bibiliography as an example which you should replace with the actual text of your document.
%% If you include other TeX files, be sure to use "\input{filename}" rather than "\input filename".
%% The latter works for you, but our parser looks for the braces and will break when uploading the document.
